          <h2 id="Intro"> Very nice to meet you! I go by Nate!</h2>
            <p> I'm a software engineer based out of Fresno, California.</p>
            <p> As a father I learned how to become more understanding.</p>
              <ul class="wrapper list">
                <li>I understand how important it is to orginize and prioritize.</li>
                <li>I understand how important quality code is for my employer.</li>
                <li>I understand and enjoy working and networking with other programmers, and other team members.</li>

    <h2 class="center" id="About"> A little bit about me </h2>
      <div>
        <p class="wrapper"> Throughout my life I always found myself interested, & dabbling in some sort of code. As funny as it sounds, I started out on Myspace. I would charge people to customize thier pages for them. Once jailbreaking iPhones came along a few years later I found myself back in code again; from adding emulators so I could play classic Pokemon games, to creating a completely different UI experience from that of regular iPhone. Fast forward to May 2021, I came across an app called Career Karma. They specialize in helping you find the right coding bootcamp, but that wasn't the best part. The best part was being able to join a community of people breaking in, and already well established in the Tech industry. I <em>love</em> networking, and quickly fell in love with this field, and the people that make are apart of it.</p>

        <p class="wrapper top"> Career Karma led me to <b><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a></b>. I can honestly say that the only other thing that has felt this natural to me would be fatherhood. I feel like a fish to water!</p>

        <p class="wrapper top"> You wouldnt let just anyone take care of your child, and the same priciple should be applied with work and code. I'm the person you can go to when you need someone that you can trust to handle the job, regardless of if it's front or back end. I am the man that you need for the job.</p>
